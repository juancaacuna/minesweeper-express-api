Minesweeper API with Express
==========

Using:

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
 - [Graphql](http://graphql.org/)
 - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
 - [Postgres Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)

I developed my own automated model generator based on `src/models.json`.
